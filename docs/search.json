I was formerly a post-doctoral researcher and PhD student at CHICAS, Lancaster Medical School, Lancaster University (UK). My PhD was supervised by Prof. Peter Diggle, Prof. Emanuele Giorgi and Prof. Jo Knight.\nMy research develops novel Model-based Geostatistical (MBG) methods to provide valuable answers to many global public health questions and support informed decision-making in low-resource settings. I have worked and currently working on several global public health problems including COPD, malaria and neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) such as river blindness, soil-transmitted helminths, schistosomiasis, Trachoma, Loiasis.\nDownload CV View Publications Email"
