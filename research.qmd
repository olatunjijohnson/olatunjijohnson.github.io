# Research interests

My research interests lie in the interface of statistics, epidemiology and health informatics with a particular interest in spatial statistics, public health and environmental epidemiology. I am interested in developing novel model-based geostatistical methods for tropical disease mapping.

My methodological themes include spatial and spatio-temporal statistics; joint modelling of multiple outcomes; geostatistical methods for spatial misalignment and Machine Learning.

My application themes include real-time health surveillance; tropical disease mapping; environmental epidemiology.

# PhD Opportunities 

I am looking for PhD students to work on the following topics:

1. Modelling clustering geo-referenced data via mixtures.

2. Inference for multivariate spatio-temporal models.

3. Hybrid geostatistical and machine learning approaches for analysing spatial data.

4. Modelling spatially misaligned data.
