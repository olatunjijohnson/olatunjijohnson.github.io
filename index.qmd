# Dr Olatunji Johnson

I'm a Lecturer in Statistics in the Department of Mathematics at [**The University of Manchester**](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/)**.** I was formerly a post-doctoral researcher and PhD student at **CHICAS**, Lancaster Medical School, **Lancaster University** (UK). My PhD was supervised by **Prof. Peter Diggle**, **Prof. Emanuele Giorgi** and **Prof. Jo Knight**.

My research develops novel Model-based Geostatistical (MBG) methods to provide valuable answers to many global public health questions and support informed decision-making in low-resource settings. I have worked and currently working on
several global public health problems including COPD, malaria and neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) such as river blindness, soil-transmitted helminths, schistosomiasis, Trachoma, Loiasis.
